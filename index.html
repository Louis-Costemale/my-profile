				<h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
				<p> My hobby is rock climbing and I want to start logging my progression through this website in the form of blogs, rants, videos, and updates in general. I think this will help me grow as a climber and let me see my progress more clearly which will be even more motivating.</p>

				<h2>2019</h2>
				<p>Novemeber 2019, right after moving to Hong Kong, is when I first started rock climbing as a result of my newly made friends asking me to join them. Strangely enough I got hooked and have been climbing since then. Of course it was a gradual process but it has now become my primary hobby in which I input a lot of time and effort into.</p>

			<div class="fourthdiv">
				<h2>2020</h2>
				<p>As a result of covid-19 rampaging through Asia, climbing gyms quickly closed down so I was not able to climb for a good 6 months. However, because of this I was able to experience outdoor climbing (both bouldering and top-rope).</p>

			<div class="fithdiv">
				<h2>2021</h2>
				<p>The first half of the year was a heavy exam period so I couldn't climb much but once I moved to Singapore in September, I started to climb much more often. I had a lot of gyms to try out and this let me meet a lot of new people. Furthermore, with the high consistency of climbing, I have been able to progress relaviely fast!</p>
